# Welcome to the Donovan Lab

The Donovan Lab incorporates quantitative spatial ecology, resilience theory, field ecology, data synthesis, and statistical modeling to generate insights into the function and resilience of social-ecological systems. We collect and analyze data from remote sensing, ecological monitoring, and social and economic surveys. Our work is in close collaboration with conservation practitioners around the world working to conserve coral reefs.

We are part of the [Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science](https://gdcs.asu.edu/), and the [School of Geographical Science and Urban Planning](https://sgsup.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University. We are located in Tempe, AZ and Kaneohe, HI with current research projects in Hawaii, French Polynesia, the Caribbean, South Africa, and globally.
